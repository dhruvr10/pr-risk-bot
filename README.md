## PR Triage Summary
- PR: [Refactor login flow and session validation #142](https://github.com/example/repo/pull/142)
- Author: `jdoe`
- Risk: **7/10 (HIGH)** — confidence: **Medium**
- Summary: 18 files, 640+/210-

### What changed (impact map)
- auth/ (files: 6)
- shared/ (files: 4)
- api/ (files: 3)
- migrations/ (files: 1)
- Config touched (env defaults/overrides may change).
- Database schema/migrations likely affected.
- Sensitive subsystem paths touched (auth/security/billing/etc).

### Risk drivers
1. Touches sensitive area paths (count=3).
2. SQL changes detected (count=1).
3. Medium diff size (640+ / 210-).
4. Touches multiple files (18).
5. Changes resilience behavior hinted in auth/token_validator.py (timeouts/retries/rate limits).
6. Touches code but no tests appear modified. Possible test gap.

### Suggested review focus
- Review auth/security/payment-related changes carefully (sensitive area touched).
- Verify migrations are reversible; check locks/indexes and rollout/rollback plan.
- Validate config defaults and environment overrides (staging vs prod).
- Request tests or a justification (touched code without test changes).
- Ask for monitoring/rollback notes for deploy (what to watch, how to revert).

### Operational notes (if applicable)
- None
